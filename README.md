## Feature Tasks and Requirements

- [x] Create a website using DjangoX as a template.
- [x] Click the Use this template button on home page of DjangoX repository.
- [x] Name your repo whatever you like.
- [x] Create a Django app of your choosing.
- [x] The specific functionality of the site is up to you but should have a model that makes use of get_user_model

## Implementation Notes

DjangoX does not use poetry out of the box. So you’ll need to look at the files DjangoX does use to see which dependencies are used.

- [x] View Pipfile and note the [packages] section.
- [x] Use poetry add to install packages listed in Pipfile
      NOTE: Mac BigSur users may need to run extra command in case of installation errors.
      export SYSTEM_VERSION_COMPAT=1

- [x] Delete the configuration files that aren’t needed anymore since we’re using Poetry
      Pipfile
      Pipfile.lock
      Dockerfile
      docker-compose.yml
      requirements.txt

## User Acceptance Tests

- [x] Verify that your pages render as expected.
